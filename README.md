# car-price-prediction
This project includes a Python notebook providing a cohesive walkthrough of the data science/machine learning pipeline, including data collection/cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis (using ML models). A large dataset of used car sales was used to examine the importance of various attributes of each vehicle on its price and to predict the price of a vehicle given its attributes.

This project was developed as a part of an open-ended final project in the CMSC320 class at the University of Maryland.
